Differences between this fork and the original:
	* Encodes form elements that have multiple values in a way that doesn't
		screw up certain query string parsers (PHP to name one) when multiple
		values are specified with the same key and no brackets to indicate an
		array

	* formToArray sets data on the DOM element (param-name.jquery-form) to indicate
		what parameter name that element actually took on. This was intended
		to make searching for elements in pre-submit work better in the case
		of the previous change where the name is slightly altered in formToArray
		to not mess up some query string parsers.
